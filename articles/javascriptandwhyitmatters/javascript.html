        <h1>so, why does javascript matter?</h1>
        <h3>written by piccolowen</h3>
        <p>i personally have not ever disabled javascript except for testing purposes. javascript has been known to have evil intents on some sites. evil may not be the right word. i'm very sure most of us have used youtube before, youtube, the base system, is not written in html. it is written in, according to a quick google search, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, and a few others, that is something i could go more into depth in on another "article", but for now i will test the effects of no javascript on youtube.</p>
        <p>now after i turned off javascript and went to youtube, i first thought that the page wasn't loading.</p>
        <img src="youtubewithoutjavascript.png" alt="youtube not loading properly because of no javascript">
        <p>you can see youtube entirely depends on javascript, however it might not be written all in javascript, it requires the <code>script</code> elements to work.</p>
        <p>one comment i have for youtube is that there is, other than chrome's little button saying javascript was blocked on this page, nothing telling you that javascript is disabled. on this site, on the pages that contain javascript a at least put the <code>noscript</code> elements saying that javascript is disabled and giving them a link to this page explaining why javascript is 'ok'. now of course i won't make you turn on javascript for my site or any sites, but keep in mind that you can always disable it for specific sites!</p>
